# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple and intuitive application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location. It utilizes CoreLocation to access the device's GPS and fetches weather data using asynchronous API calls through the OpenWeather API.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Get the latest weather conditions for the user's location.
- **Temperature and Weather Description**: View the current temperature and a brief description of the weather conditions.
- **Humidity and Wind Speed**: Access additional weather details such as humidity percentage and wind speed.
- **Daily Forecast**: Get a 5-day weather forecast for the user's location.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the Weather App:

### Prerequisites

- Xcode: Make sure you have Xcode installed on your macOS system.
- Swift Package Manager (SPM): The app uses SPM for handling dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the Weather App repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HardiB-Salih/weatherApp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd weather-app
```

3. Install the required dependencies using Swift Package Manager:

```bash
swift package update
```

4. Open the Xcode workspace:

```bash
open WeatherApp.xcworkspace
```

### API Key

To access weather data from the OpenWeather API, you need to obtain an API key. Visit the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/) to sign up for a free account and generate your API key. Once you have the key, update the `WeatherService.swift` file with your API key:

```swift
// WeatherService.swift

private let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Build and Run

1. Select the desired simulator or a connected device in Xcode.

2. Press the "Build and Run" button (or `Cmd + R`) to build and run the Weather App on your chosen device.
